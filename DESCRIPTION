Title: DESpace: a framework to discover spatially variable genes and differential spatial patterns across conditions
Version: 1.99.1
Description: Intuitive framework for identifying spatially variable genes (SVGs) and differential spatial variable pattern (DSP) between conditions via edgeR, a popular method for performing differential expression analyses.
  Based on pre-annotated spatial clusters as summarized spatial information, DESpace models gene expression using a negative binomial (NB), via edgeR, with spatial clusters as covariates. 
  SVGs are then identified by testing the significance of spatial clusters.
  For multi-sample, multi-condition datasets, we again fit a NB model via edgeR, incorporating spatial clusters, conditions and their interactions as covariates.
  DSP genes-representing differences in spatial gene expression patterns across experimental conditions-are identified by testing the interaction between spatial clusters and conditions.
